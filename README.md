# Mini Dictionary

This project implements a mini dictionary app where a user can enter a search term and 
receive a list of defintions for a word from the https://dictionaryapi.dev/ api

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### Deployment

This app will be temporarily deployed to S3 - I will update the link here soon.
